# StarMapper

Interactive map of our closest stellar neighbors using C++ and SDL2 along with data from SIMBAD

![Example](example.png)

Can be modified to use any celestial data to visually display spatial information about stellar objects. This can be done by modifying and running the script res/simbad.txt and overwriting the res/stars.txt file with new stellar objects. Scale will also need to be changed to see objects close together.

# Future Improvements

Adding dynamic scale
Adding an information tab which gives extra information when a star is selected
Fixing exit button (Current requires ESC key to shutdown)
Adding UTF-8 Support
